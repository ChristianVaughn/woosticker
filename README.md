# woosticker

It's like [uSticker](https://github.com/apsun/uSticker) except with exceptionally worse programming. Code is not anywhere near publishable state, but app is functional at the least so I thought I would share.

The main difference between this app and uSticker is that uSticker piggybacks on top of Gboard's custom sticker functionality. Unfortunately, that feature has been removed as of Gboard version 10.3. woosticker instead implements a new keyboard altogether and uses the [Commit Content API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/image-keyboard) to send images.
